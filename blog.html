                Template literals are sometimes informally called template
                strings, because they are used most commonly for string
                interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of
                placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result
                in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to
                perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of
                the template literal.Template literals are enclosed by backtick
                (`) characters instead of double or single quotes. Along with
                having normal strings, template literals can also contain other
                parts called placeholders, which are embedded expressions
                delimited by a dollar sign and curly braces: ${expression}. The
                strings and placeholders get passed to a function — either a
                default function, or a function you supply. The default function
                (when you don't supply your own) just performs string
                interpolation to do substitution of the placeholders and then
                concatenate the parts into a single string. To supply a function
                of your own, precede the template literal with a function name;
                the result is called a tagged template. In that case, the
                template literal is passed to your tag function, where you can
                then perform whatever operations you want on the different parts
                of the template literal.
