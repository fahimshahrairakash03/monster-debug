                The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack
                and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event
                Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it
                to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration
                is called a tick in the Event Loop.
                <br />
                Also we can say The event loop is a process that waits for the
                Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task
                Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop
                triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If
                there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the
                Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.
